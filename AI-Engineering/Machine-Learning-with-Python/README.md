<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [first course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python?specialization=ai-engineer) of the AI Engineering, I've learnt four main components:
1) I learnt about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
2) I got a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 
3) Other models, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy 
4) Projects, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
