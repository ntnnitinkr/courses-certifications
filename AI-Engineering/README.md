The rapid pace of innovation in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is creating enormous opportunity for transforming entire industries and our very existence. After completing this, I got a practical understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I've cleared fundamental concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I utilized popular Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries such as SciPy, ScikitLearn, Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow applied to industry problems involving object recognition and Computer Vision, image and video processing, text analytics, Natural Language Processing, recommender systems, and other types of classifiers.
I am able to scale Machine Learning on Big Data using Apache Spark. I've built, trained, and deployed different types of Deep Architectures, including Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks, and Autoencoders.
At the end, I have completed several projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and become armed with skills for a career as an AI Engineer.
