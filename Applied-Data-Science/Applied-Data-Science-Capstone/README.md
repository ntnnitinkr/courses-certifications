<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [fourth course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) of the Applied Data Science, I've learnt about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. I've learnt how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. I've also learnt how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. I've utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data.
