<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [third course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization) of the Applied Data Science, I've learnt how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, we are using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
