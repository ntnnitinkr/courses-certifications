This is an action-packed specialization is for data science enthusiasts who want to acquire practical skills for real world data problems. It appeals to anyone interested in pursuing a career in Data Science, and already has foundational skills (or has completed the Introduction to Applied Data Science specialization). I've learnt Python. I've then learnt data visualization and data analysis. Through guided lectures, labs, and projects I've got hands-on experience tackling interesting data problems.
