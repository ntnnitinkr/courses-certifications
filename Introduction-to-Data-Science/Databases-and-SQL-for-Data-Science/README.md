<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [fourth course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science) of the Introduction to Data Science, I've worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I'vel created a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs I've practiced building and running SQL queries. I've also learnt how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.
