<h1 align="center">About the Course</h1>

In the [second course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science) of the Introduction to Data Science, I've learnt about Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, Apache Zeppelin and Data Science Experience. I've learnt about what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class Labs, I am able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala. To end the course, I've created a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience and demonstrate my proficiency preparing a notebook, writing Markdown, and sharing my work with my peers.
