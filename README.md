In this Professional Certificate learners developed and honedhands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning. Learnersstarted with an orientation of Data Science and its Methodology,became familiar and used a variety of data science tools, learnedPython and SQL, performed Data Visualization and Analysis, andcreated Machine Learning models. In the process they completedseveral labs and assignments on the cloud including a CapstoneProject at the end to apply and demonstrate their knowledge andskills.
